----

gflsegpy is a full Python 3 implementation of the group fused Lasso (GFL) for multiple change-points detection [1].
It is largely based upon [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org),
while the original MATLAB implementation of the authors is available at http://cbio.ensmp.fr/GFLseg.

> ***Abstract**—We present the group fused Lasso for detection of multiple change-points shared by a set of co-occurring one-dimensional signals. Change-points are detected by approximating the original signals with a constraint on the multidimensional total variation, leading to piecewise-constant approximations. Fast algorithms are proposed to solve the resulting optimization problems, either exactly or approximately. Conditions are given for consistency of both algorithms as the number of signals increases, and empirical evidence is provided to support the results on simulated and array comparative genomic hybridization data.*
